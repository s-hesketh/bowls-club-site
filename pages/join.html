            <p> Crown Green Bowls is a game for all ages, easy to play but takes a lot longer to master! It's 
                an inexpensive sport, an ideal way of making new friends and helps to keep you fit. Etwall is 
                a friendly club with an excellent bowling green and always extends a warm welcome to new members.
                <br>
                <br>
                The club runs numerous men, women and mixed teams in several leagues catering for all standards 
                from beginner to experienced. You can join as a social member which entitles you to use the 
                facilities and play on the green whenever there is not a match being played, or join as a full 
                member and play in one of our many leagues teams.
                <br>
                <br>
                We have several teams which are perfect for members new to the sport, where you can enjoy 
                competitive bowls in a relaxed atmosphere as your skill and experience builds. Take a look at 
                our Teams page for more details.

                <br>
                The bowling season normally lasts from early April to end of September. If interested come and 
                give it a try without obligation. All you need to begin with is a flat-soled pair of shoes and a 
                willingness to try something different!
