            <h2>Come and Join Us!</h2>
            <p> Located in the pretty South Derbyshire village of Etwall, it features one of the finest greens in
                the country and provides excellent bowls and social facilities. The club was founded in 1965 and
                now runs numerous mens, ladies and mixed teams, playing in the Derby, Burton and Belper Leagues.
                <br>
                <br>
                The green opens early April and during the season matches are played most afternoons Monday to 
                Saturday and each evening Monday to Friday. In total we play around 250 league matches until 
                the season ends in September.
                <br>
                <br>
                We're a friendly club and are always delighted to welcome new members of all ages!
